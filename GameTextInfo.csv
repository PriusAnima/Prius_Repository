PLAINMSG,120202,..................,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120203,Sigh... Drives me crazy.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120301,At last... I found the pendant. The one that has a picture of my only family in it....,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120302,Legend of the one who never lost? Invincible warrior? Sigh... It was all luck.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120303,All in the hopes to see my daughter one more time while I'm alive.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120304,I fought like a madman. Just like every other captives...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120305,Now that I think about it. It would've been better to have died.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120306,If I knew I'd be sacrificed before I could meet my family...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120307,But the legends about me get me ashamed and miserable...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120308,Fight without a weapon? It's the only way when you don't get a weapon...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120309,Courageous and fearless? It's the only way to survive...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120310,Useless struggle put me on a lifetime of guilt trip.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120311,Advent Regnus Gathering did some terrible things...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120312,"Anyhow, I've put in some of the will to live that seeped into this pendent into",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120313,this Bead of Purification,,,,,,,,

PLAINMSG,120602,Cha!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120603,Bon Appetit! Hahahaha!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120701,I can't believe I ate such horrifying food! It's a real taste of courage...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120702,I feel like I can do anything now!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120801,Hmm? There's a strange message that's mixed in here. Let's see...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120802,Hmph..!! What are all these nonsensical numbers?,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120803,It doesn't match anything that we have...!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120804,And some have been embezzled!?,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120901,"I thought it was just a rumor from a soldier, but it must've been true.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120902,"I'll make Akaram regret this, kekeke.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,120903,"Anyway, it's surprising that timid Kakaba has such unbelievable courage.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121001,How is it? You seem to be captivated by my awesome strategy.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121002,"That perfect disguise even fooled me, *chuckle*.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121003,You may admire some more. You may someday get close to where I am.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121101,I will avenge whoever took your life. That is the logic of strength and principles of Lon Mas!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121102,"Now head to the city. Solutus, the City of Freedom!!",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121201,Wait! What are you doing!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121202,"A wreath..Did Kayan order it? Pfft, weakling...",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121203,This is an insult to the proud warriors!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121204,Bunch of Flowers for condolences... why should we express condolences to them?,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121205,Does he take pity in the fact that they died?,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121206,Go tell Kayan to stop with the uselessness!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121207,These proud and honorable men do not need any condolences.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121301,"It's finished at last! With this henna, you should be able to draw tattoos that look just like the real thing~",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121302,Please... Please don't tell lord Gaurun...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121303,What? A fake tattoo? This is absurd. Heads will roll if lord Gaurun hears about this!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121304,"I know you lost your memory, but I'd never imagined you'd do such a thing...",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121305,You'll need to have a good reason for this!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121401,Ah..ahk..It's painful...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121402,....What! What did you bring!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121403,!!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121404,Message from Elder Geken...,,,,,,,,

PLAINMSG,121406,"Although your ignorance may have masked your pride as Lon Mas temporarily,",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121407,I trust that you still have that pride in you. That's why I gave you a second life.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121408,"But, do not expect a third. - Elder'......",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121409,"Ugh, damn it... Now it's in deep trouble...",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121501,"Lock and keys... of course the reaction comes very easily, ha.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121601,Running into fire like a moth... I'll make you pay for this. Feel the power of Advent Regnus Gathering!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121701,Hm.. I wonder what the results are like...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121702,Okay the results are out! This is!!!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121703,The levels are much higher than expected! This must be from the influences of Ancient Demogorgons.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121704,The question is where the power gushes out from...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121705,It has to be them...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121801,This is good enough. Now pass on my forgiveness to them...',,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121901,"The one who brought you the Letter of Introduction seems like a fool at first, but he is never really useful.'",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,121902,"But still, sometimes he seems to never work hard. He is all yours.'",,,,,,,,

PLAINMSG,122001,That large bone there is suspected to be the giant's.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122002,It's often discovered near this Swamp of Death...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122003,You must know the story of the Hero Wars?,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122004,"Well, you can ask me if you don't.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122005,"Anyway, the giants were used as slaves by the Advent Regnus Gathering",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122006,and ones that use up all the strength end up like this. It's a sad story...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122101,Hyah~~~~,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122102,Cha!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122103,Bon Appetit!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122201,I suppose I should...try...,,,,,,,,

PLAINMSG,122204,"Savage Food is suppose to be effective, but infamous for terrible taste. I ended up eating it...",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122205,"Had I known, I would've have even tried...",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122206,"Now I know! Not getting prematurely scared, that is courage!",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122301,What are all these nonsensical numbers? It doesn't match anything that we have...!,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122302,"And some have been embezzled!? Hm, if this is true. This is serious.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122401,"I thought it was just a rumor from a soldier, but it must've been true.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122402,"I'll make Akaram regret this, kekeke.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122403,"Anyway, it's surprising that timid Kakaba has such unbelievable courage.",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122501,I will not get caught...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122502,I will never get caught...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,122503,I WILL get caught like this! Sorry guys! I can't do this!! See ya!!,,,,,,,,

PLAINMSG,123105,We're allies who fought to reach the same goal. Our blades just ended up pointing at each other.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,123106,That was not even our fault... No one blames you for it.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,123107,Our enemy is not you. It's the Advent Regnus Gathering who made us fight each other.,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,123108,And we are still under the influence of them...,,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,123109,"Don't be sorry or anything like that. If we can't understand each other, who would?",,,,,,,,
PLAINMSG,123110,...Thank you.. Thank you for being so generous to someone like me...,,,,,,,,
